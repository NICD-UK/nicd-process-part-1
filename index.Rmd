## Data Science Processes

A **data science process** includes:

1. data science workflow (e.g. CRISP-DM)
2. collaboration framework (e.g. Scrum)

The data science workflow provides the **what** and the collaboration framework provides the **how**. A popular example of a data science process is:

- **Microsoft**: Team Data Science Process (TDSP)

## Project Templates

The Microsoft TDSP also includes a **project template** in addition to a data science workflow and collaboration framework. Other data science templates include

1. [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) (Python)
2. [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net) (R)

The *focus* of this presentation is on project templates. Data science workflows and collaboration frameworks will follow.

## Project Templates

A **good** project template should be:

1. broadly applicable
2. encourage good practice
3. language agnostic

Developing a broadly applicable project template requires defining some broad data science terms. These terms are:

- **data question**
- **data source**
- **data product**
- **data pipeline**.

## Data Question

A **data question** is a question related to data, introduced in [What is the Question?](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/Stats_What_Question_2015.pdf?g_zGQR5m3rDJqwXqJ3DxLI5pXZ3hNdHk) There are six types of data question:

1. descriptive
2. exploratory
3. inferential
4. predictive
5. causal
6. mechanistic

## Data Source

A data question requires one or more relevant datasets. A dataset is available from a **data source**. Data sources include:

- databases
- flat files (e.g. CSV file)
- web services (e.g. web API)

**Note**: Different data questions require different data sources.

## Data Product

A data question requires an answer. The answer to a data question is a **data product**. Data products include:

- tables
- figures
- reports
- models

**Note**: Different data questions require different data products.

## Data Pipeline

A **data pipeline** imports data from one or more data sources and transforms that data into a data product that is deployed. This could be performed in a single `pipeline.script`:

![](figures/pipeline.png){width=100%}

## Project Template Development

The proposed project template *currently* has four directories:

1. `src/` directory
2. `data/` directory
3. `reports/` directory
4. `notebooks/` directory

The **structure** and **reasoning** for these directories follows. The emphasis is on encouraging good practice.

## `src/` Directory

Different data questions require different data pipelines (different data sources and products). It is important that data pipelines can be efficiently **developed** and **maintained** when the data question *inevitably* changes. This can be facilitated by:

1. question independent code in `clean/` directory
2. a `clean.script` for each data source
3. question dependent code in `wrangle/` directory
4. a `wrangle.script` for each data question
5. model dependent code in `model/` directory
6. a `model.script` for each model-based data product

Other data products will follow.

## `src/` Directory

![](figures/clean-wrangle-model.png){width=100%}

## `src/` Directory

![](figures/sources-deploys.png){width=100%}
    
## `src/` Directory

![](figures/models.png){width=100%}

## `data/` Directory

The clean, wrangle and model scripts should write data to different data directories:

1. `clean.script` writes to `data/clean/`
2. `wrangle.script` writes to `data/wrangle/`
3. `model.script` writes to `data/model/`

The `clean/` and `wrangle/` data directories match the `staging/` and `production/` directories in the [cloud data platform](https://www.manning.com/books/designing-cloud-data-platforms) architecture.

## `reports/` Directory

Tables and figures in reports are the data products that answer descriptive and exploratory questions. Reports require many artefacts (tables, figures and files) that should be contained in a report directory (`reports/<report_name>/`).

## `notebooks/` Directory

In order to populate the pipeline scripts with transformations, data exploration is required. Data exploration is best performed in notebooks (e.g. `.ipynb` and `.Rmd` files). It is recommended that:

1. notebooks should *not* include pipeline transformations
2. notebooks are not used for collaboration
3. notebooks use naming: `<ghuser>-<notebook_name>`
